#  Handwritten Digit Recognition (CNN + MNIST)

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset**.

You can also upload your own handwritten digit image and the model will predict it.

##  Project Structure

- `cnn_digit_recognition.ipynb` – Train and test the CNN model using Jupyter Notebook  
- `digit.png` – Your custom digit image for testing (1.png)
- `cnn_mnist_model.h5` – Saved trained model
- `requirements.txt` – List of required libraries
